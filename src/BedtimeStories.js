          Once upon a time a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and
          two stepsisters. Poor Cinderella had to work hard all day long so the
          others could rest. It was she who had to wake up each morning when it
          was still dark and cold to start the fire. It was she who cooked the
          meals. It was she who kept the fire going. The poor girl could not
          stay clean, from all the ashes and cinders by the fire.
